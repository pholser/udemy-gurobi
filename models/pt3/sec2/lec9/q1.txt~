1. A carpet manufacturer produces rolls of carpet of a standard width. Each roll is 200 feet long.
Their B2B customers purchase carpet in lengths of 50 feet, 75 feet, or 100 feet. List all of the
patterns of carpet that can be cut from a 200-foot roll into combinations of 50, 75, and 100 feet
plus scrap (if any), e.g., "two 50-foot rolls and one 100-foot roll". Separate "complete patterns"
(that don't have enough scrap to add another roll) from “incomplete” patterns – for example, a
pattern of “three 50-foot rolls” has excess that is large enough to be used for another 50-foot
roll, so it would be considered “incomplete”.
