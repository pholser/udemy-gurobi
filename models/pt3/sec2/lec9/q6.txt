6. A moving company has large moving trucks that it uses to carry customers' belongings from one
city to another. The moving company charges customers at three different levels: a full truck, a
half truck, and a quarter-truck. Customers are charged as the smallest level they can fit into.
(So, a customer whose belongings take 0.4 truck volume would be charged as a half-truck.) List
